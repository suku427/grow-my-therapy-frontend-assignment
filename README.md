## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a submission for the **Grow My Therapy Front-End Developer Internship**. The goal was to take a generic template (*Lilac*) and transform it into a trustworthy, high-converting digital presence for a mental health professional.

### The Challenge
1.  **Clone:** Replicate the layout and grid system of the original template.
2.  **Redesign:** Apply a new visual identity (colors, fonts, imagery) suitable for therapy.
3.  **Adapt:** Rewrite all copy based on Dr. Reynolds' provided profile.
4.  **Innovate:** Design and build a custom "Our Office" section.

## 🎨 Design & Theme Decisions

The original *Lilac* template was stark. For Dr. Reynolds, I shifted the aesthetic to evoke **safety, grounding, and professional warmth**.

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Color** | `Sage Green` (#4A7C59) | Represents growth, nature, and emotional balance. |
| **Secondary Color** | `Warm Beige` (#F5F0E6) | Reduces eye strain and creates a welcoming "living room" feel. |
| **Typography** | `Merriweather` (Serif) | A classic serif font that builds trust and academic authority. |
| **Imagery** | Nature & Soft Interiors | Avoided clinical stock photos; focused on calming environments. |
